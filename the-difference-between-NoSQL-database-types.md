## Key/Values
  - Best example is Redis
  - In practice this looks like caching SQL data tables
  - Example use case is Amazon top seller lists. 
    - Rather than ping the SQL database 100,000 times per second
    - Maybe Amazon is ok with only updating every minute
    - Redis holds/serves the tables

## Big Table 
 - Best example is Cassandra (not the one from Wayne's World)
 - Good for a ton of write tasks
    - Ingest twitter firehose
    - Record real-time trading data
    - This provides "linear write scalability"
    - The vast majority of startups or companies with "Data Science" use Cassandra underneath Hadoop

## Document 
  - Best example is MongoDB
  - Mongo is schemaless and embedable
    - Embedable may not be that good in practice (like hard coding in a model)
    - [This is their website, btw](www.mongodb.com)

## Graph 
  - Best example is Neo4J
  - Great for graph-shaped problems
    - Recommendation engines, ratings systems, social media, etc
